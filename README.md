# java-bean-generator package
This is a package for the Atom editor developed by Github.
The package helps us develop java beans quickly with minimal typing. It automates the generation of the getter and setter methods. All we need to specify are the class name and the names and types of all the properties. It also has the facility of adding properties to an existing java class.

Toggle keys : Ctrl+Alt+j - to generate a bean, Ctrl+Alt+k - to add some properties
